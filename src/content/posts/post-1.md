So, it's Winter break and I've decided to start a blog to write down things that I learnt so that I don't forget. (Keeping this page until I write an actual post so that I remember how to format the posts!)

  <img class="pro-img" width="500px" height="281" src="/image-1.webp" alt="First Image" />
</div> -->
